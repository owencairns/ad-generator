# Your rule content
This project uses Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI with NextJS 15. This means there is NO TAILWIND CONFIG FILE. All daisy related updated must be in [globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css).

NEVER try to make a TAILWIND CONFIG FILE.

For styling:
- ALWAYS use daisy Primary, secondary, bg, etc. for colors.
- NEVER hardcode colors
